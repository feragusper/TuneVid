# TuneVid

An Android application to that has the potential to identify infected people with covid-19, including the asymptomatic ones. 
The app consists in a measure of acoustic impedance changes in tissues of the Ear-Nose-Mouth channel. 
Any change will be detected and it will be established a priority identification statistic for subsequent PCR tests to identify this disease. 
This measurement could be extended for any other respiratory disease and will prevent hotspots spread.
